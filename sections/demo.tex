    \textbf{Hello World!} test \LaTeX. %notice how the command will end at the first non-alphabet charecter such as the . after \LaTeX
    \LaTeX{} is a great program for writing math. I can write in line math such as $a^2+b^2=c^2$ %$ tells LaTexX to compile as math
    . I can also give equations their own space: 
    \begin{equation} % Creates an equation environment and is compiled as math
    \gamma^2+\theta^2=\omega^2
    \frac{12}{12}
    \end{equation}
    If I do not leave any blank lines \LaTeX{} will continue  this text without making it into a new paragraph.  Notice how there was no indentation in the text after equation (1).  
    Also notice how even though I hit enter after that sentence and here $\downarrow$
    \LaTeX{} formats the sentence without any break.  Also   look  how      it   doesn't     matter          how    many  spaces     I put     between       my    words.

    For a new paragraph I can leave a blank space in my code.

\subsection{Problemy}
Poprzez nieprawidłowe ułożenie tekstu trenowałem bardzo dużo\\
